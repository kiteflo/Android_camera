"I simply wanna take a picture using camera intent and process the image in my app (display, store, post etc.)" - if that's what you're heading for this tutorial might help you. Why did I create this tutorial as  googling for "android camera intent" produces thousnds of result? Because using 99% of the Google result will make you ending up like this...:

1) Hurra - got a snippet firing up the camera

2) WTF - why is the image received that small...?

3) Ok...need to do some more complex magic in order to process the intent result...

4) SHIT F#$ยง/#ing tutorials - how can I access the image directory using some weired Android path magig...?

5) uh no - all camera images are landscape even these have been taken in portrait mode!

...

12) FUCK - I WILL CHANGE PLATFORMS AND MIGRATE TO WINDOWS PHONE

...

19) Try to get the adress of the guy who posted a code snippet you used in step 13 in order to smack his bottom as his snippet is crap!

...

24) it's working!

25) watch the clock - ok this one took me more than 48 hours...

Ok this can be in a much easier way I thought, that's the reason I created this tutorial so simply follow the steps below, use the provided classes and you will end up in a nice intent based camera solution within couple of minutes...
